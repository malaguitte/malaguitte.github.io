## Hello World :wave:

My name is Anderson Malagutti :bowtie:, and I'm a Brazilian `software developer`, who has lived for almost two years in Toronto, Canada.
I have graduated in `Software Development and Analysis` by FATEC in Brazil, and I also have studied `Computer Programming` at Seneca College in Canada. 

I am passionate by `technology`, languages and cultures. 

:coffee: is always a good idea.

_I am still going to make this page better later_ :trollface:
