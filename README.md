## Hello World :wave:

My name is Anderson Malagutti, and I'm a Brazilian `software developer`, who has lived for almost two years in Toronto, Canada.
I have graduated in `Software Development and Analysis` by FATEC in Brazil, and I also have studied `Computer Programming` at Seneca College in Canada. 

I am passionate by `technology`, languages and cultures. 

:coffee: is always a good idea.

Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/upmalagutti/):link: or send me an [email](mailto:upmalagutti@gmail.com):email: . :smile:


I am still going to make this page better later :trollface:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/malagutti/malagutti.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
