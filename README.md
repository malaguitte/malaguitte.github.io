## Hello World :wave:

My name is Anderson Malagutti :bowtie:, and I am a `software developer`, who currently lives in Prague, Czech Republic. 
I have also lived for about two years in Toronto, Canada. :maple_leaf:

I have graduated in `Software Development and Analysis` by FATEC in Brazil, and I also have studied `Computer Programming` at Seneca College in Canada. :computer: :mortar_board:

I am passionate by `technology`, languages and cultures. 

:coffee: is always a good idea.
